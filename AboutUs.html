      <h2>A Brief History of the Haven Night Shelter (Cape Town)</h2>
      <p>
        Origins & Founding (Mid-1970s to 1978)

The tragedy of homelessness was brought into sharp focus in District Six during the 1970s. NICRO social workers encountered numerous destitute individuals forced into living on the streets. Their investigations revealed alarming conditions: many were surviving behind dustbins, under cars, or in alleyways around Harrington Street

Motivated to act, NICRO initiated community outreach—documenting the crisis, screening films on homelessness across Cape Town, and lobbying for action. This collective effort eventually led to the opening of the NICRO Night Shelter on Harrington Street in January 1976

Formation & Evolution (1978–2004)

Inspired by these early efforts, Fr Roger Hickley and Sam Gross partnered to formally launch what became known as The Haven Night Shelter in 1978 in Cape Town

The organization has since evolved through multiple legal and nonprofit milestones:
Registered as a Section 21(a) (Not for Gain) Public Company in 1983
Transitioned to a Non-Profit Organisation (NPO) in 2000
Recognized as a Public Benefit Organisation (PBO) in 2004

Mission, Vision & Method

Mission: “To get the homeless to a home.” The Haven emphasizes permanent reintegration over short-term relief

Vision: A world where no one is forced to live on the streets, supported by strong community and institutional networks 
<a href="https://www.haven.org.za/meet-us?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Click here</a>

Their approach includes:
Providing temporary shelter, physical care, social welfare, and family reunification
Employing fieldworkers who proactively locate street-dwelling individuals, help locate their families, and facilitate safe return home

Establishing a structured intake process: a welcoming supervisor explains services, followed by registration, assessment, a personal development plan, and where possible, minimal shelter fees or a “Buy a Bed” subsidy for those in need

Growth & Expansion

From its humble beginnings in one location, The Haven now operates 15 shelters across the Western Cape, including District Six, Claremont, Wynberg, Kalk Bay, Bellville, Paarl, Mossel Bay, and more

Community initiatives like the "Buy a Bed" campaign help cover shelter fees for the most vulnerable, ensuring accessibility and engagement through a sense of responsibility

Impact & Continued Relevance

The Haven remains a leading force in transitional shelter efforts across Cape Town. For instance, its Napier Street site expanded by 63%—going from 96 to 156 beds—with city support and donations

This aligns with broader municipal strategies offering temporary safe spaces, expanding bed capacity during winter, and embedding social services like rehabilitation, health support, and work programmes to aid reintegration
